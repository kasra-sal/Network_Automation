# Network Automation

The aim of this project is to utilize Ansible and Jinja to automate the configuration of switches and routers. It serves as a means to demonstrate a fundamental comprehension of these technologies. While basic networking knowledge was applied to make the project functional, the project itself was not intended to showcase networking expertise.

# Before We Start

Please note that this repository comprises the essential YAML files needed to execute this basic automation. However, it is important to mention that certain built-in modules, such as ios.ios.l2_interfaces, were not employed due to limitations that would have constrained the desired outcome. Instead, custom CSV files were generated and Jinja was utilized to import necessary variables into a configuration format, providing more flexibility. It's worth noting a few things:
  -  The contents in the repo are a base point of what could be done, feel free to take ideas and improve it.
  -  This is not an educational project for networking, it is intended to illustrate how you could send configs manually or through pipelines.
  -  The devices are hosted on gns3 vm, you will need to acquire ios qemus through purchasing license from cisco modeling labs.
  -  You may want to host the topology on a server or cloud for better performance and scalability, as 12 cores will not be enough to handle more than what's already implemented.

```
or if you are using an Arch-based distro:
```
sudo pacman -Sy git
```

# Topology Diagrams
To gain a better understanding of what we will be doing, I made topology diagrams. Use them as reference point. (Click to zoom in)

Here is my initial hand drawn draft:

# Initializing Configs for Remote Management
To start using ansible to remotely configure each node, I created a base config initialized that will configure ssh, rsa keys, domain name, necessary addresses on interfaces to be able to remotely manage it. Here is an example output :

## Router:
```
en
 conf t
 hostname Router1
 interface g0/3
 ip address 192.168.1.10 255.255.255.0
 no shutdown
 exit
 ip name-server 8.8.8.8
 ip domain-name homelab.com
 crypto key generate rsa
 2048
 ip ssh version 2
 username admin privilege 15 secret PaSsWoRd
 line vty 0 15
 transport input ssh
 login local
 ```
## Switch:
```
en
 conf t
 hostname Switch1
 interface vlan 99
 ip address 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0
 no shutdown
 exit
 int g3/3
 switchport trunk encap dot1q
 switchport mode trunk
 switchport trunk native vlan 99
 ip default-gateway 192.168.1.254
 ip name-server 8.8.8.8
 ip domain-name homelab.com
 crypto key generate rsa
 2048
 ip ssh version 2
 username admin privilege 15 secret PaSsWoRd
 line vty 0 15
 transport input ssh
 login local
```

This template should be more than sufficient to get us started. 

# Configuring Ansible for Remote Management
Once we pushed necessary configs for the switches and routers, we can configure ansible with the following commands:
inside your ansible.cfg file, type in the following command if it doesn't already exist
```
[defaults]
host_key_checking = False
``` 
It's important to know that, this change should ONLY be implemented in a lab environment as it poses a securirty risk by using weaker encryption for key pairing. 
After we have configured the ansible.cfg, change the directory to the project directory and run the following commands:
```
cd Network_Automation
ansible switch -m ping -i inventory.yml
```
This will use the module ping to test connectivity to the switches. If everything is correct, it will respond with "pong"

To run the playbook provided, use the following command:
```
ansible-playbook site.yml -i inventory.yml
```
The process of generating the CSV file and utilizing it for remote configuration is outlined below, with a brief description of each step:

1. A CSV file is created using "csv_maker.py". Although Excel could have been used, this script was utilized instead.
2. An entry is added to main.yml within the respective roles folder => tasks.
3. A Jinja template is created in the template folder that corresponds to the CSV file.
4. In main.yml within the tasks folder, an entry is added to replace the necessary parameters within the Jinja template and then push them to the device using the ios_config modules.

Keep in mind that due to virtualization limitations, you may need to wait for longer period of time for the config to go through. If you receive "Timeout" error, increase timeout time for that specific task.

# Jinja Template Outputs

To keep this section short, I've only included 1 template output for each task.
Here is what some of the Jinja templates will output:

## VLAN
DLS1 :
```
{% if inventory_hostname in groups['distribution'] or inventory_hostname in groups['access'] %}
{% for i in vlan_list %}
  vlan {{ i.vlan_id }}
  name {{i.name }}
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}
```
```
vlan 20
name office
vlan 30
name accounting
vlan 40
name voip
vlan 50
name guest
vlan 70
name unused_ports
vlan 1000
name native
vlan 99
name management
```

## Unused Ports
DLS1:  
```
{% for i in unused_list %}
  {% if inventory_hostname == i.device %}
  {% if skip_loop is not defined or not skip_loop %}
  interface range {{ i.interface }}
  switchport mode access
  switchport access vlan 70
  shutdown
  {% if loop.first %}{% set skip_loop = True %}{% endif %}
  {% endif %}
  {% endif %}
{% endfor %}

```
```
interface range g0/0-3, g1/2-3, g3/0-2
switchport mode access

shutdown
```

## STP
DLS1: Template
```
{% if inventory_hostname in groups['distribution'] or inventory_hostname in groups['access'] %}

  {% if skip_loop is not defined or not skip_loop %}
  {% set associated_vlan = i.associated_vlan.split(',') %}
  {% for index in range(associated_vlan|length) %}
    spanning-tree vlan {{ associated_vlan[index] }} priority {{ i.priority }}
  {% endfor %}
  {% else %}
  {% if loop.first %}{% set skip_loop = True %}{% endif %}
  {% endif %}
  {% endif %} 
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

passive-interface default
interface range vlan 99 , port-channel 1, g1/0-3, g2/0
ipv6 enable
ospfv3 20 ipv4 area 0
no shutdown
```

# TFTP
Although there are choices like sftp, I decided to keep it simple since this is just a lab. So I just configured my server and connected it to the same lan as the topology. 

Here is the screen shot of configs being pulled from the devices:
